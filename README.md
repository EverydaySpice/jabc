Java ABC Notation Parser

If you want to generate the parser base classes with ANTLR based on the lexer **AbcNotationLexer.g4** and the parser **AbcNotationParser.g4** grammar you can run the **compileAntlrAbcParser.bat** (currently only Windows, sorry).
You need so set the **ANTLR_LIB** environment variable pointing to a current Antlr java library (you can download it from here: http://www.antlr.org/download.html )
